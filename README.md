#ProjectileFLTK

Hello!

This is a projectile simulator made using the FLTK library.


## Setting up and running

If you do not have FLTK already set-up, you might want to check out [this youtube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UUsZAEEn1cw).

Once that is done, clone the repository, go to the source folder and make the project.

```
cd ${REPO_DIR}/src
make
```


## Demo

Here is ProjectileFLTK in action!
